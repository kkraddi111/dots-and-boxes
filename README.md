🧸 A Trip Down Memory Lane

This project isn't just about code; it's a love letter to simpler times. It's born from the quiet joy of a childhood spent with paper and pen, where the most epic battles were fought in the squares of a hand-drawn grid. The goal was to capture that feeling—the simple, pure fun of outsmarting a friend one line at a time—and bring it to the digital world. This is a small piece of my childhood, and I hope it brings a smile to your face too.
